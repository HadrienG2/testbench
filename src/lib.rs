//! Testing and benchmarking tools for concurrent Rust code
//!
//! This crate groups together a bunch of utilities which I've found useful when
//! testing and benchmarking Rust concurrency primitives in the triple_buffer
//! and spmc_buffer crates.
//!
//! If it proves popular, other testing and benchmarking tools may be added,
//! based on user demand.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! For examples of this crate at work, look at its "tests" and "benchs"
//! submodules, which showcase expected usage.

/// Perform some operation while another is running in a loop in another thread
///
/// For multithreaded code, benchmarking the performance of isolated operations
/// is usually only half of the story. Synchronization and memory contention can

/// For this reason, it is often useful to also measure the performance of one
/// operation as another "antagonist" operation is also running in a background
/// thread. This function helps you with setting up such an antagonist thread.
///
/// Note that the antagonist function must be designed in such a way as not to
/// be optimized out by the compiler when run in a tight loop. Here are some
/// ways to do this:
///
/// - You can hide the fact that the code is run in a loop by preventing the
///   compiler from inlining it there, see this crate's `noinline::call_mut()`.
/// - You can obscure the fact that inputs are always the same and outputs are
///   are not used by using `core::hint::black_box()` on nightly Rust, or its
///   emulation by the Criterion benchmarking crate.
/// - You can generate inputs that the compiler cannot guess using a random
///   number generator, and use your outputs by sending them through some sort
///   of reduction function (sum, min, max...) and checking the result.
